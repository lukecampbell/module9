## 1 History of Internet Policies in Business

### 1.1 Reason for Policies

The primary purpose for an internet usage policy is to protect the company and the 
employees. With cyber crime against businesses on the rise every year we should 
exercise common sense and a simple policy to limit our exposure and susceptibility
to these attacks.

The easiest way for an attacker to exploit company computers is with a computer virus.
Most computer viruses are transmitted through the internet, sometimes through email. 
There are in some cases, disreputable websites which when visited can install the virus
onto the computer. 

E-mail spam can sometimes render an email service useless. Soliciting unwanted emails 
is illegal. Some computer viruses can turn our e-mail servers into spam bots, sending
out thousands of messages to unsuspecting contacts which would seriously degrade our
business image.
