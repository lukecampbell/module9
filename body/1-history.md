## 1 History of Internet Policies in Business

### 1.1 Reason for Policies

The primary purpose for an internet usage policy is to protect the company and the 
employees. With cyber crime against businesses on the rise every year we should 
exercise common sense and a simple policy to limit our exposure and susceptibility
to these attacks.

#### Computer Crimes

The easiest way for an attacker to exploit company computers is with a computer virus.
Most computer viruses are transmitted through the internet, sometimes through email. 
There are in some cases, disreputable websites which when visited can install the virus
onto the computer. 

Computer exploits can also be found inside e-mail attachments such as portable
document format (PDF) or Microsoft Office documents. IBM released findings on the
number of vulnerabilities discovered in common document formats. In 2011, there were
70 known critical vulnerabilities disclosed in the common document formats. Nearly
every employee expects to see documents in e-mails like these, it is our 
responsibility to let our employees know when it is safe to use them, which ones
to use and how to verify the sender of the document (IBM 67).

#### E-mail spam

E-mail spam can sometimes render an email service useless. Soliciting unwanted emails 
is illegal. Some computer viruses can turn our e-mail servers into spam bots, sending
out thousands of messages to unsuspecting contacts which would seriously degrade our
business image.

E-mail spam rates for 2011 and 2012 are decreasing. Several products provide private
and corporate owners with the ability to filter wide ranges of spam and e-mail 
attacks. IBM's spam filter database contains more than 40 million relevant spam 
signatures (IBM 38). We employ a very sophisticated suite of tools to decrease our received
spam but ultimately it is the employee's responsibility to protect his or her account
from spamming services and most importantly not to forward or engage in spamming
himself or herself.

#### Malware

In 2012 IBM assessed that 50% of all malware links are placed on pornographic or 
gambling websites (IBM 8). Malware is short for malicious software; it is used by an attacker
to disrupt normal operations, steal information or infect adjacent systems. By limiting
our employees' exposure to potentially malicious content we can minimize inherent
threats to our systems.

It's becoming increasingly easy for attackers to gain access to machines through 
the web. IBM reported nearly 800 disclosed web vulnerabilities in web browsers.
Every vulnerability in a web browser can be exploited by an attacker cleverly
crafting code and placing it on a website. All the attacker has to do is wait
for someone to visit the website and then he can gain access to the computer system.
Every employee should understand the dangers associated with some websites. 
Keeping our software up to date can help prevent exploitation, software vendors
frequently look for bugs and vulnerabilities to patch. As soon as a new version
is released, IT will usually update it on all of the systems that have that piece
of software.

#### Proprietary Information

If by now you haven't heard of WikiLeaks, then you may be out of the loop. WikiLeaks is
an organization credited with the dissemination of classified documents from the 
U.S. Government. Sensitive information being spread on a wide scale like this
can hurt anyone, especially a government agency. Our information is no different.
We should take every precaution possible to protect our sensitive information.
Sensitive information includes research data, financial information, trade secrets,
employee information, passwords, and any piece of information that anyone can
reasonably expect should not be publicly available. In 2007, an anonymous hacker
exploited a vulnerability in the secure server at Thomason Financial, a company
providing web services to investors and publicly traded corporations. The hacker
was able to obtain highly sensitive market information before it was publicly 
released, putting the company in jeopardy (Hagar).

Nearly every piece of important information to a company is going to be stored
on a computer at some point. Access to the information should be controlled
carefully to prevent unnecessary disclosure. When a company is attacked over the
web, the majority of the time the attackers simply want to deface a website
or cause an interruption in business services. On occasion, some attacks will be
aimed at retrieving information. In 2011, Sony, a Japanese multinational conglomerate
specializing in electronics production, was attacked by a group of hackers. The
attackers discovered a database of client accounts that Sony maintained. The hackers
publicly released all of the contents of the database. It was speculated by law 
enforcement that several of these account passwords were the same passwords
used by clients for other services as well, and that criminal organizations
began to use the information to commit crimes and commit identity theft (FBI). Sony
had to manage a gigantic setback because this information was not properly
stored and managed. It turns out that Sony did not even encrypt the passwords
as most computer systems do by default.



### 1.2 Absence of Policy

In the absence of a policy, employees probably will not deliberately engage in 
damaging activities but we should encourage the right behavior. Employees would not
likely look at pornographic material while at work but they may check their bank 
accounts, or perhaps pay their bills using an online service. The problem arises when
another employee uses the same computer and sees private information that does not 
apply to conducting business. The company can be held liable for the actions of its
employees. 

The other damaging consequence because of a lack of policy is a productivity killer: 
wasting time. A 2010 Salary.com survey indicates that about 64% of employees waste
near an hour of work every day by idly surfing the internet. A quick reality check on
the math shows us that at an average salary the business wastes $456 per week for
employees to browse the internet, not including the opportunity cost.

Without computer monitoring we would not be able to discover network bottlenecks, 
determine which employee is downloading a very large file, which could disrupt the 
network or even discover an attacker using the system. The company could also be held
for damages if an employee willingly uses company computer equipment to commit a crime.

### 1.3 Examples

In 2009, LVRC Holdings filed a suit against Christopher Brekka, a former employee. 
Brekka had a very long commute so he frequently e-mailed company documents to his
personal laptop to do business. LVRC had no internal policy to govern the access or 
use of company computer systems.

After a number of sensitive number of documents were
transmitted to his personal computer and after his termination LVRC noticed that
Brekka's account was being accessed and sensitive company information was being 
stolen. LVRC is sueing Brekka in federal court; Brekka is claimed to have violated
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

In the case of LVRC, it is easy to see how the lack of a policy led to a very negative
consequence. The employee was not protected because he had no policy to secure his
right to use personal laptop for business. The company was not protected because
they did not specify, in writing, the terms of use for their documents, computer 
systems and client information.
