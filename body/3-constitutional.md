## 3 Constitutional Concerns

### 3.1 Fourth Amendment

The fourth amendment protects private citizens from unreasonable search and seizure
from the government. We do not represent the Federal or State Governments and are not
violating the fourth amendment. However, we should not arbitrarily monitor employee 
communications. 

Unreasonable monitoring may lead to an employee feeling uncomfortable or untrusted.
We should limit our monitoring to cases where managers deem it necessary and have a
legitimate reason to monitor an employees computer use. Such examples are if a manager
suspects an employee of committing a crime or using company computers to send e-mail 
spam. IT should not authorize monitoring solely because an employee is suspected of
browsing non-business, employees may occasionally browse the web on their break. 

Even though we do not promote personal use of our computers, it is likely to happen
and spending time and money to prevent it may not be worth the cost. 

### 3.2 Constitutional rights

Employees have the right to privacy. Any personal information about an employee stored
on a Company domain account is confidential information and must be treated as private
information and handled in accordance with our privacy policy. No employee may 
deliberately reveal private information about another employee.

### 3.3 Separate Issues
