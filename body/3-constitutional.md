## 3 Constitutional Concerns

### 3.1 Fourth Amendment

The fourth amendment protects private citizens from unreasonable search and seizure
from the government. We do not represent the federal or state governments and we are not
violating the fourth amendment. However, we should not monitor employee 
communications without a reason. 

Unreasonable monitoring may lead to an employee feeling uncomfortable or untrusted.
We should limit our monitoring to cases where managers deem it necessary and have a
legitimate reason to monitor an employee's computer. If a manager 
suspects an employee of committing a crime or using company computers to send 
discriminating e-mail, then monitoring an employee's computer activity is warranted. 
IT should not authorize monitoring solely because an employee is suspected of
browsing non-business related websites.

Employees should understand that there is no reasonable expectation to privacy
while using a corporate computer system. Any e-mail may be reviewed by at any time
by someone, the internet browsing history might be reviewed by the IT staff,
a manager might walk in while a chat window is open. If something is inappropriate
at any time, then it should not be on the computer system.

### 3.2 Constitutional rights

The first amendment which protects the freedom of speech and religion ties closely
with federal anti-discrimination laws. We do not support or condone any form of 
discrimination. Any discrimination in the work place is grounds for review and 
possibly termination. Employees should feel free to express themselves in a purely
professional manner. We do not deliberately seek to infringe on someone's personal
expressions but if their expressions interfere with business or someone else we may
intervene.

Each employee has the right to work free from prejudice or discrimination. The 
only discrimination we tolerate is that of position and skill. Any digital content
produced by an employee is a direct reflection on the company's image and brand.
Our internet policy should reflect the consequences and actions we will take to 
prevent a hostile work environment.

Most employees just want to work, do a good job, receive feed back and go home.
It is highly unlikely that any employee will go out of his or her way to obstruct
or infringe on the liberty of another while at work. For a computer system this could
be if an employee stays logged in and another employee uses the computer to post
or send a very rude e-mail in the hopes to be comical. This is a violation of an
employee's right to work in a friendly environment. 

#### Employee Privacy

Employees have the right to privacy. Any personal information about an employee stored
on a Company domain account is confidential information and must be treated as private
information and handled in accordance with our privacy policy. No employee may 
deliberately reveal private information about another employee. Any financial or
identification information entered into a computer system must be separate from
publicly available data or storage. No employee should deliberately allow his
or her own information or the information of another employee to become publicly
accessible. 

Human resources should take extra precaution to ensure the privacy of every employee.
The information that human resources has to manage is specifically sensitive to
the privacy and safety of our employees. Human resource employees undergo extra
training on the handling of employee information. In accordance with federal law
we should also be documenting all receipts of employee confidential information
such as social security numbers, bank accounts, payroll or marital information.
Handlers of the information must also take precautions to ensure that the 
information is not available to all employees, only to those who must have access
to it.

The personal lives of employees is often shared in the workplace but sometimes
negative events can be brought to the workplace as well. Rumors and gossip
carry this information farther than it should ever go and it makes the personal
business of an employee the business of everyone around them. We do not encourage
employees to gossip but it is expressly forbidden by our computer use agreement.
If a damaging rumor spreads and it is discovered to have been spread using a 
company e-mail account, the employee that sent the e-mail could face termination.

Ultimately, everyone should do what they can to protect the privacy of employees 
in the company. Employees should understand that in the work place they should
have no reasonable expectation of privacy but know that no one should deliberately
seek to infringe on it. If employees have concerns about their information being 
used either by an employee, or a third party they should bring the issue to 
human resources or their direct supervisors.
