## Conclusion

### Draft Policy

#### Computer Use

Company computers are for the purpose of conducting Company business only. Personal 
use of Company computers is not allowed. Employees will be granted access and given
software licenses for any application they need to perform their jobs. 

#### Software Licenses and Access

Employees will be given licenses to authorized software. All software will be installed
by a computer administrator only. Normal employees are not authorized to install 
software on any Company computer system. 

No access shall be given to non-employees to use any Company computer. 

#### Internet Usage

Employees should avoid visiting websites not suitable for work. Websites that are 
pornographic, discriminatory, racist, political, and social media do not promote our 
business and are off-limits. If an employee accidentally visits one of these websites,
he or she must immediately leave the website.

We block certain well-known websites that are not business related.  

#### Email Usage

Any email sent using the Company domain name is property of the Company.

#### Right to access

Only authorized employees may use Company computer systems. Employees will be given
a domain user account and an e-mail account to conduct business with. No employee
may grant a non-employee access to Company e-mail or computers.
