## Conclusion

### Draft Policy

#### Computer Use

Employees will be given a desktop computer or laptop depending on business function.
Each employee is responsible for the computer to ensure that no physical harm is done
to the machines. Employees will be issued a domain account to access the computer and 
the Company network. It is every employee's responsibility to keep the account 
information discrete and not to share account access with anyone.

Some employees will be given special access to confidential and proprietary 
information. Employees will sign and acknowledge a non-disclosure agreement prior to 
be granted access. Once access is obtained, an employee may not share or transmit any
information found on Company computers or networks.

Company computer systems are for business use only. Employees will not use company
equipment for personal use. Personal use includes but is not limited to: social media,
movies, shopping, and pornography. 

#### Software Licenses and Access

Employees will be issued a standard suite of software for conducting business. 
Additional software can be requested through the IT department. Only IT administrators
are authorized to install software on company computers. No employee may copy company 
software or license keys for personal use. 

No employee may knowingly install pirated or unauthorized software on company 
hardware. If an employee suspects a piece of software may be pirated he or she should
immediately notify an IT administrator and his or her supervisor.

Employees are encouraged to make frequent backups of work onto company external 
hard drives and the company private network share drives. Any employee can request
an external hard drive for backups from the IT department.

#### Internet Usage

Employees should avoid visiting websites not suitable for work. Websites that are 
pornographic, discriminatory, racist, political, and social media do not promote our 
business and are off-limits. If an employee accidentally visits one of these websites,
he or she must immediately leave the website.

We block certain well-known websites that are not business related.  

#### Email Usage

All employees will be given access to a Company e-mail account. It is the employee's
responsibility to protect his or her e-mail access and to prevent the further 
dissemination of spam. Employees should not use their business e-mail account to 
register for personal services online. 

We employ a spam protection program to limit the amount of incoming internet spam 
to our e-mail servers. Every employee should be proactive in limiting the amount of 
spam they receive.

#### Right to access

Only authorized employees may use Company computer systems. Employees will be given
a domain user account and an e-mail account to conduct business with. No employee
may grant a non-employee access to Company e-mail or computers.
