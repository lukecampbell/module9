## 2 Laws

### 2.1 Connecticut State Laws

#### Connecticut General Statutes § 31-48d

Connecticut State General Statutes §31-48d requires employers to give employees a prior
written notice of intent to monitor internet usage, email and computer activity. The 
only exception to this rule is if an employee is suspected of committing a crime. An 
employer may monitor an employee's electronic communications without notice if the 
employee is suspected of using a company's computer system to commit a crime.

The statute provides businesses with the capability to monitor employee internet
activity, and email. We will include a written notice to employees inside the company
computer use policy and employee handbook. Employees must sign acknowledgement that he
or she has read the handbook. 



#### Connecticut General Statutes § 42-471

Connecticut General Statutes § 42-471 requires any business that collects social
security numbers must maintain a privacy policy. The privacy policy should be publicly
available and must protect the confidentiality of the numbers. The policy must also 
limit the number of people who have access to the Social Security numbers.

Requires any person which collects Social Security numbers in the course of business 
to create a privacy protection policy. The policy must be "publicly displayed" by 
posting on a web page and the policy must (1) protect the confidentiality of Social 
Security numbers, (2) prohibit unlawful disclosure of Social Security numbers, and 
(3) limit access to Social Security numbers.


### 2.2 Federal Laws

#### Computer Fraud and Abuse Act 18 U.S.C. § 1030

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act outlines the legal definitions, and penalties for
crime using computer systems. The act governs cases where computers were used 
in federal offenses, or where the crime was interstate in nature. The USA 
PATRIOT Act amended certain sections of this act to include anyone who attempts
to commit an offense as well. 

The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act has been cited in cases against companies. 
Businesses should protect themselves from becoming victim to computer attacks and
protect their systems from being used for perpetrating crimes as well. An internet
policy can legally protect a company in the case where the company did not engage
in the crime directly and when only a small group of employees participated in 
the act. 

Businesses can also use the act to protect themselves. Any person who attempts to
access a computer without authorization could be held in violating of this act
and grant a federal scrutiny against the perpetrator. 


#### Theft of Trade Secrets 18 U.S.C. § 1832

The theft of trade secrets can plague any business that becomes a victim to it.
A trade secret is any form of financial, business, scientific, technical, economic,
or engineering information where the owner has taken measures to keep the 
information secret and the information has a measurable economic value. Losing
proprietary information can cripple even a thriving business.
